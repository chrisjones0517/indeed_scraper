# Indeed Scraper

### Overview
##### This is a fairly simple scraping app intended to give web developers a visualization of what technologies are most popular by job listing keywords in their respective local job markets. Since the focus is on utility, the UI/UX is not polished. Please feel free to style the application to your preferences.

### Use
##### To use the app, simple clone it to your local machine, then run ```npm install```. Once the install has completed, run ```node index```, and then wait until the you see data populate into the terminal.
