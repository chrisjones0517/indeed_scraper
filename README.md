# Indeed Scraper

### Overview
##### Although statistics about the growth rate of various technologies are available, this may not help an entry-level/junior developer determine the best focal point in which to gain employment in the industry in a given locale. This fairly simple scraping app is intended to give web developers a visualization of what technologies are most popular by keywords contained in job listings in their respective local job markets. Since the focus is on utility, the UI/UX is not polished. Please feel free to style the application to your preferences.

### Use
##### To use the app, simple clone it to your local machine, then run ```npm install```. Once the install has completed, run ```node index```, and then wait until the you see data populate into the terminal. Lastly, open your browser to ```localhost:3000```, and the graphical display should be rendered. The user can change any of the query data at the top of the ```index.js``` file to suit his/her search preferences.

## Happy Job Hunting!!!
